# CodeQL Configuration for Telegen
# Suppresses intentional TLS configuration patterns

name: "Telegen CodeQL Config"

# Paths to ignore from analysis
paths-ignore:
  # Offset detection binaries - test code that intentionally uses InsecureSkipVerify
  - configs/offsets/**

# Query filters for specific rules
query-filters:
  # Exclude TLS certificate check alerts for user-configurable settings
  # These are intentional design decisions for:
  # - Internal PKI with self-signed certificates
  # - Development/testing environments
  # - User-controllable `verify_ssl` and `insecure_skip_verify` config options
  - exclude:
      id: go/disabled-certificate-check
      # Only exclude in files where TLS verification is user-configurable
      # The http_client.go uses cfg.VerifySSL and cfg.TLS.InsecureSkipVerify
      # which are explicit user configuration options
